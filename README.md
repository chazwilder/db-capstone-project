Module one
In the first module, you’ll receive an introduction to the Little Lemon project environment and help them to set up their database.

You’ll then recap processes and concepts related to setting up the project environment. Once you have completed each recap, you’ll then carry out a related task.

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to:

Set up a repository,

Set up a MySQL instance server in MySQL Workbench,

Create and implement an ER diagram data model,

And commit the project.


Module two
During the second module, you’ll continue to help Little Lemon manage their database by adding sales reports and creating a table booking system. Like module one, you’ll recap key processes and concepts to help you complete the module tasks. 

In the first lesson, you’ll create a virtual table using JOINs to summarize the restaurant’s data. You’ll also create optimized queries to manage and analyze data. You’ll then commit your progress to Git.

In the second lesson, you’ll create SQL queries to check available bookings based on user input. You’ll also create SQL queries to add and update bookings. You’ll then test your queries and commit your progress to Git.

By the end of this module, you’ll have demonstrated your ability to:

Create a virtual table,

Create optimized queries,

Test SQL queries,

And commit your progress to Git.


Module three
The third module requires you to help Little Lemon using data visualization and database clients. Again, during this module you’ll review key processes and concepts to assist you with these tasks.

In the first lesson, you’ll set up a Tableau Workspace in which you’ll create an interactive dashboard to present Little Lemon’s sales and profits.

In the second lesson, you’ll create a database client using Python. You’ll then implement functions to query the database. Finally, you’ll commit your progress to Git.

By the end of this module, you’ll have shown that you can:

Work with Tableau to create interactive dashboards,

Create a database client,

And add query functions.

Module four
In the final module, you’ll review your Little Lemon database. You’ll then present your Little Lemon database to another learner for review. Likewise, you’ll also receive another learner’s Little Lemon database for review. Finally, you’ll then review an exemplar of the Little Lemon database to compare your own against.
